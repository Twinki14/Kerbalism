# Kerbalism - Forked Science

## Why?
- Kerbalism hasn't been worked on in over a year now seriously, while there's been rumours of a Kerbalism 4.x, I haven't seen any active development
- I quite like playing Kerbalism for it's Science overhaul, but made me wish that I had a different Life Support system like Snacks or could use mods like Heat Control without needing to wonder if it's compatible or not
- I've regularly seen Reddit or Discord comments how people wish they had Kerbalism, but only Science without requiring config adjustments

## To-do
- Totally remove RemoteTech support. The state of support is unknown. Kerbalism - Forked Science does it's own modifications to CommNet as it's a complete science overhaul, the CommNet modifications were originally implemented by the Kerbalism devs in a fairly realistic fashion. If you want the "Require KSC connection for Control" you can enable that in the KSP standard settings and achieve nearly the same level of difficulty. RemoteTech DevAntennas is supported(?)
- Reduce Automation features, custom "Action Groups" don't really seem needed
- Remove danger messages, or allow them to be customized
- Remove all non-us translations, until I can figure out KSPLocalizer
