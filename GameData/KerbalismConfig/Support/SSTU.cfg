// SSTU support patches - https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs
// Created 31-07-2019 by Gotmachine and Steamp0rt
// - Heavily based on the (removed) patches from this commit : 
//   https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism/commit/7376019e5f8fd31a200728ac23eeb1cad8988a94
//   All "rebalancing" patches were excluded as this has nothing to do here and given the very unstable state
//   of SSTU those are very likely to break in the future. I prefer to keep this as lightweight as possible.
//   Submit changes to the SSTU repo if you think some things are unbalanced.
// - At the time of writing, this only work with the dev branch of SSTU as some code changes were required
//   for proper support of habitat and solar panels. So a SSTU version greater than 0.11.48.160 is required.
//   See https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/pull/803 and https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/pull/791

// Only patch SSTUModularPart if it has a solar panel. 
// This isn't fail-proof as a modular part can have switcheable solar panels and "Solar-None" as the default option,
// but we want to avoid adding the SolarPanelFixer on parts that don't have a solar panel.
